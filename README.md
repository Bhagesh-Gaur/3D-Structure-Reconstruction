# 3D-Structure-Reconstruction
### YouTube Link for the demo.
## Motivation
* 3D scene representation is a challenging and ongoing research area in
computer vision, with numerous techniques proposed, from traditional image
processing to advanced methods like deep neural networks and transformer
models.

* This work employs traditional image processing techniques and Incremental
Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm for 3D reconstruction to create 3D point
clouds of objects.

* 3D reconstruction from multiple photographs is crucial for applications like
autonomous driving and augmented reality; however, specialized sensors like
LIDAR can be expensive and complicated to use.

* Advances in digital cameras, improved resolution, and clarity have enabled
new, more affordable 3D reconstruction techniques using only RGB cameras,
without the need for expensive sensors.

* Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstructs 3D structures from multiple
photographs taken from different viewpoints, with the main challenges being
resilience, precision, completeness, and scalability; an incremental approach is
used to address these issues.

## Problem Statement
* Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstructs 3D structures from multiple
photographs taken from different viewpoints.

* This work employs traditional image processing techniques and Incremental
Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm for 3D reconstruction to create 3D point
clouds of objects.

* The proposed method is evaluated using specific 3D reconstruction datasets
to assess its performance.

## How to run?? 
```
  1. Create the conda environment on your system using the **environment.yml** file using the following command:
      ```
        conda env create -f environment.yml
      ```
  2. Setup a project after installing JDK 16(prefered) or above.
  3. Add the project files to the src folder.
  4. Now run the project using CoWin as the main class.
