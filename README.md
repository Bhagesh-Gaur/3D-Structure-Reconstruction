# 3D-Structure-Reconstruction
This work employs traditional image processing techniques and Incremental Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm for 3D reconstruction to create 3D point clouds of objects. The proposed method is evaluated using specific 3D reconstruction datasets to assess its performance.
